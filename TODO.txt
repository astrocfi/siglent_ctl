** General **

- Add README file
- Add error checking to opening resource and other VISA accesses
- Add menu to change device short name

** Acquisition **

- Save to CSV
- Load from CSV

** XY Plotting **

- Bug - sharing Y axis doesn't refresh the position of the Y axis label
- Implement better way to handle breaks between time sequences instead of just inserting
  a dummy NaN. Maybe separate lists of measurements that are then stitched together?
  Right now if there's a segment with only one measurement it isn't drawn.
